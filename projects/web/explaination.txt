Explanation of the Structure:

jobbot.com/ (Root Directory): Contains overall project files like README.md, .gitignore, and global configuration files.

frontend/: This clearly separates the client-side application.

public/: For static files served directly by the web server (e.g., index.html).

src/: Contains all the development code for your frontend application.

assets/: For static assets that are processed by your build tools.

components/: Reusable UI elements. Organize them in their own subfolders for better encapsulation (e.g., Button/Button.js, Button/Button.module.css).

pages/: Represents different views or routes of your application.

services/: For interacting with your backend API.

utils/: Generic helper functions.

hooks/: (If using React) Custom hooks for reusable logic.

store/: For state management (e.g., Redux, Vuex, Context API).

styles/: Global styles, Sass variables, etc.

backend/: This separates your server-side application logic.

src/: Contains the core backend code.

controllers/: Handle requests and responses, often calling services.

models/: Define data structures and interact with the database.

routes/: Define your API endpoints and link them to controllers.

services/: Contain the business logic, interacting with models and potentially other services (like your AI integration).

utils/: Helper functions for the backend.

config/: Configuration for databases, external APIs, etc.

middlewares/: Functions that run before a request reaches a controller (e.g., authentication).

ai_models/: This is crucial for your project! It keeps your AI-related code separate and organized. You'll likely have different models for different tasks (parsing, matching, generating).

Each subfolder should contain the model files, any required scripts, and a requirements.txt if it has specific Python dependencies.

database/: For database-specific files like migrations, seeds, or schema definitions if you're managing your database directly.

devops/: For files related to deployment, continuous integration/delivery, and infrastructure.
